The product I recently encountered and that is worth mentioning is Affinity Designer. It is an alternative program to design tools such as Adobe Ilustrator or Adobe Xd.
It got my attention because of the possibilities it gives. It has all the options a vector desing program should have. The main advantage of that program is the price. It costs
only around 40$ and does not require user to pay for it every month. After you pay the initial price, this tool is under your command for ever - along with the future updates.
If I was asked to convince my friend to buy this tool, I would show him all of the options and possibilities it has and Adobe Il doesn't. I could also show him some of designs
I created with Affinity Designer. At the end, price comparison would probably tip the scale on Affinity Designer side.
If makers of that software asked me what to add or change in it, I would suggest adding a perspective tool. It is not a necessary tool, but certainly it is something nice to have.
